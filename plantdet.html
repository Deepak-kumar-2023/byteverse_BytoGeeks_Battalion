              Black spot is one of the most common diseases found on roses, but
              it
              <br />
              can also occur on other ornamental and garden plants. This fungal
              <br />
              disease causes black, round spots that form on the upper sides of
              <br />
              leaves. Lower leaves are usually infected first. Severe
              infestations
              <br />
              cause infected leaves to turn yellow and fall off the plant.

              Powdery mildew is a fungal disease that affects many of our <br />

              <br />
              is an easy one to identify. Infected plants will display a white

              <br />

              <br />

              to understand the differences between the two. Powdery mildews are

              Plant blight is a common disease. Remember the potato famine in

              the 1840s? As a result of the blight, one million people died.

              But other than potatoes, blight also affects other plants, <br />
              particularly tomatoes. Blight is a fungal disease that spreads
              <br />
